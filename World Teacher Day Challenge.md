**Thank you for registering to the TwilioQuest World Teacher Day Challenge- we're so thrilled you're here, and can't wait to read your submission!**


***After the competition, we will be creating a public repository of classroom activities which you will be able to access on GitHub. By submitting your application, you are agreeing to your activity being shared publicly.*** 

Here are the next steps: 


**1. Get Creative**

Think back to the most enjoyable Computer Science class you've taught this year, for both your students and you! Did you introduce a new programming concept in an immersive way? Did your students build something remotely? Did you encourage them to learn a concept in an innovative manner?

Here are some example's we've **loved** from educators in our community: 
* Robot building 
* "Fun Friday's" 
* Kinetic sand to build models of human organs
* Flipped classroom activities for learning Python


**2. Submit your activity by Friday, October 16th**

**Format:** 

Please use [this submission template](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/17dW1KM8N32Upt4JmoFKh-ZG9ks-vkEsP) to submit your lesson plan. If you would like to include something else (video, app, anything else!) you can do so in the submission form. Please be sure to review the requirements below. 

We will be sharing all submissions in the [public classroom resources repository.](https://github.com/TwilioQuest/Awesome-CS/tree/master/classroom-resources)  

**Requirements:**
* Share with us why and how you came up with the lesson plan
* Tell us what computer science concept you teach and to whom (age group or grade/level of education)
* Share how you incorporated distance learning
* Did you focus on making this lesson accessible to all students?
* Is this something other educators could replicate? 
* Tell us what the outcome was and why this was an especially successful activity.

[When you're ready to submit your work, please do so here.](https://twiliostartups.typeform.com/to/wJe7bC)
