**Looking for more details? Read on below**

**1. Get Creative**

Think back to the most enjoyable Computer Science class you've taught this year, for both your students and you! Did you introduce a new programming concept in an immersive way? Did your students build something remotely? Did you encourage them to learn a concept in an innovative manner?

Here are some example's we've **loved** from educators in our community: 
* Robot building 
* "Fun Friday's" 
* Kinetic sand to build models of human organs
* Flipped classroom activities for learning Python


**2. Submit your activity by Friday, October 16th**

**Format:** 

We have standardised the submission format so that any teacher, anywhere in the world could pick up your lesson plan and use it in their classroom. Please use [this submission template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1koQa9dgMiWasVIprdNzo44D7BxD19fUS/view?usp=sharing) to submit your lesson plan. If you would like to include something else (video, app, anything else!) you can do so in the submission form. **Please be sure to review the requirements below.** 

Here are some questions you can use to get started:
* Share with us why and how you came up with the lesson plan
* Tell us what computer science concept you teach and to whom (age group or grade/level of education)
* Share how you incorporated distance learning
* Did you focus on making this lesson accessible to all students?
* Is this something other educators could replicate? 
* Tell us what the outcome was and why this was an especially successful activity.

**How will the submission be assessed?**

The submission will be assessed on these three key criteria: 
1. Distance learning: You should highlight how your lesson plan has been created/adapted for distance learning
2. Accessibility: Tell us how your lesson plan was created to be inclusive and equitable for all students.
3. Fun / Engagement Factor: We want to hear why you think this lesson is particularly fun for your students!

[When you're ready to submit your work, please do so here.](https://twiliostartups.typeform.com/to/wJe7bC)
