<br>
Here are the next steps: 
<br>
1. Get those creative juices flowing<br>
Think back to the most creative Computer Science class you've taught this year. Did you introduce a flipped classroom approach? Were your students introduced to new programming concepts in a particularly fun and engaging way? <br>
2. Submit your activity by Friday, October 16th<br> 
We would love for you to get creative with the format of your submission. When you're ready to submit your work, please email Chiara with your activity (cmassironi@twilio.com) <br>
